This is a Python project that scrapes and gathers information about all registered US charirties. 
The performance ratings and contact details are originally from Charity Navigator. 
To avoid unnecessarily bombarding the live Charity Navigator production site, 
this script scrapes from the old snapshot at https://web.archive.org/web/20160526021624/
